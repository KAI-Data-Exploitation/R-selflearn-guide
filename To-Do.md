# To Do

- Proof read / tone of voice
- Convert to `ggwordcloud` when it becomes available
- Convert to `tidytext` for bigram generation
- Add in more details about `flexdashboard` and `crosstalk`
- Add static network details: `ggraph` \ `igraph`
- Add section on programming with R
- Package summary?
- Check on `geom_sf` if `ggplot2` gets updated
